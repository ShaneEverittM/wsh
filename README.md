# wsh - A worse shell
## Why?
I want to learn how to make a shell. Not the one you make in undergrad that does some, most, or even a lot of what actual shells do. I want to make one with all the bells and whistles, up there with zsh, fish, and bash. All that being said, it will probably be less intelligently designed than those, but I want to try something that functions differently.
## Can I use it?
No. It currently isn't. I don't even know how you got here.
